# Iris_Flower_Classification
A python application for classification of the Iris Flowers using different machine learning algorithms.

The project requires us to build machine learning models for our chosen dataset. We will need to
perform pre-processing on your data. We will need to build and comprehensively evaluate a range of machine learning
models. The most promising models should then undergo hyper-parameter optimization.
We are also required to pick a specific topic to research and then incorporate the result of this
research into your models and evaluate the impact. For example, if our dataset is imbalanced our
research could focus on the techniques that are commonly used to address imbalance. We would
then proceed to incorporate some of these into our evaluation and assess the impact on our results.
